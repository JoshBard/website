    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Josh Bardwick. I am studying computer engineering at Boston University with a concentration in Machine Learning.
        My graduation is expected in May 2025.

        My concentration in Machine Learning has given me in-depth experience with deep neural networks, particularly image 
        segmentation convolutional neural networks like detectron2. My coursework has involved many projects with PyTorch, a
        library I am confident in using. Additionally, I have taken operating systems at BU, a difficult, and programming
        intensive course that has given me excellent C and C++ skills. My courses have taught me programming as it relates to
        hardware, an important understanding that has improved my abilities as an engineer.

        ## ADD NOTE ABOUT EK210 AND LOGIC CLASSES ##

        Beyond my coursework, I spent my junior year working as a research assistant at the Performance and Energy Aware
        Computing Lab (PEACLab). At PEACLab, I was responsible for rebuilding a simulator used to test and optimize
        power-matching algorithms in large data centers. These algorithms are critical for reducing the environmental cost of
        high-performance computing. This role was a great learning experience. The old simulator is a large program with
        thousands of lines of code and initially, it was difficult for me to parse. I came away from this position with
        relevant experience in software design and working on a team with other people's code. 

        This role was also important for me because I have a passion for environmental protection. I hope to use my skills as an
        engineer to protect our Earth, especially as tech innovation requires increasing rare raw materials and energy. Part of
        my passion for the environment comes from growing up on the coast in California. I spent two summers working at a kayak
        rental company called Seatrek. Spending my day on the San Francisco Bay was wonderful and I look to work on the water in my
        future. 

        I am also not just an engineer! Some of my passions include running (trail and road), music, Formula 1,
        and Magic the Gathering.
