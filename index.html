        My concentration in Machine Learning has given me in-depth experience with deep neural networks, particularly image 
        segmentation convolutional neural networks like detectron2. My coursework has involved many projects with PyTorch, a
        library I am confident in using. Additionally, I have taken operating systems at BU, a difficult, and programming
        intensive course that has given me excellent C and C++ skills. My courses have taught me programming as it relates to
        hardware, an important understanding that has improved my abilities as an engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part of my education has also centered around logic and hardware design. I have worked extensively with the hardware 
        description language Verilog. My projects in Verilog include building a tennis game with the lights on an FPGA and
        creating a five-stage CPU with lookahead logic. As far as physical circuit building goes, I designed and assembled
        the circuit for an overhead touchless light. This was a challenging project because of the small size of the housing
        and required complex wiring with Arduinos in parallel.
    </p>

        Beyond my coursework, I spent my junior year working as a research assistant at the Performance and Energy Aware
        Computing Lab (PEACLab). At PEACLab, I was responsible for rebuilding a simulator used to test and optimize
        power-matching algorithms in large data centers. These algorithms are critical for reducing the environmental cost of
        high-performance computing. This role was a great learning experience. The old simulator is a large program with
        thousands of lines of code and initially, it was difficult for me to parse. I came away from this position with
        relevant experience in software design and working on a team with other people's code.

        I am studying computer engineering at Boston University with a concentration in Machine Learning. My graduation is expected in May 2025.

        I am passionate about contributing to climate change research as part of an engineering team. The ocean is an integral piece of our ecosystem, and I aim to help researchers collect critical data using autonomous vehicles. My expertise in low-level programming languages, performance-aware programming, embedded systems, machine learning, and reinforcement learning positions me well to make meaningful contributions.
    </p>

        Originally from the Bay Area, California, I discovered trail running a few years ago on the Dipsea Trail. I recently completed my first marathon-distance run in Boston, where the challenging air made it all the more rewarding.

        Beyond engineering, I am an avid Magic: The Gathering playerâ€”deckbuilding and drafting are two of my favorite hobbies. Check out my Moxfield profile!
